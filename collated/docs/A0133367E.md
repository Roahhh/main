### 1. Architecture

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="600"><br>

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above summarizes the high-level design of Agendum.
Here is a quick overview of the main components of Agendum and their main responsibilities.

#### `Main`
The **`Main`** component has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/agendum/MainApp.java). It is responsible for initializing all components in the correct sequence and connecting them up with each other at app launch. It is also responsible for shutting down the other components and invoking the necessary clean up methods when Agendum is shut down.


#### `Commons`
[**`Commons`**](#6-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to Agendum's log file to record noteworthy system information and events.


#### `UI`
The [**`UI`**](#2-ui-component) component is responsible for interacting with the user by accepting commands, displaying data and results such as updates to the task list.


#### `Logic`
The [**`Logic`**](#3-logic-component) component is responsible for processing and executing the user's commands.


#### `Model`
The [**`Model`**](#4-model-component) component is responsible for representing and holding Agendum's data.


#### `Storage`
The [**`Storage`**](#5-storage-component) component is responsible for reading data from and writing data to the hard disk.


Each of the `UI`, `Logic`, `Model` and `Storage` components:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java`
interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.<br>
<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>


#### Event Driven Approach
Agendum applies an Event-Driven approach to reduce direct coupling between components. For example, consider the scenario where the user inputs `delete 1` described in the  _Sequence Diagram_ below. The `UI` component will invoke the `Logic` componentâ€™s  _execute_ method to carry out the given command, `delete 1`. The `Logic` component will identify the corresponding task and will call the `Model` component _deleteTasks_ method to update Agendumâ€™s data and raise a `ToDoListChangedEvent`.

The _Sequence Diagram_ below illustrates how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete 1` to delete the first task in the displayed list. The `UI` component will invoke the `Logic` component's _execute_ method to carry out the given command. In this scenario, the `Logic` component will identify the corresponding task and invoke `Model`'s  _deleteTask(task)_ method to update the in-app memory and raise a `ToDoListChangedEvent`.

<img src="images\SDforDeleteTask.png" width="800">

> Note: When Agendum's data is changed, the `Model` simply raises a `ToDoListChangedEvent`.
  It does not directly request the `Storage` component to save the updates to the hard disk.
  Hence, `Model` is not directly coupled to `Storage`.

The diagram below shows what happens after a `ToDoListChangedEvent` is raised. `EventsCenter` will inform the subscribers (the `UI` and `Storage` components). Both components will then respond accordingly. `UI` will update the status bar to reflect the 'Last Updated' time while `Storage` will save the updates to the task data to hard disk. <br>

The following sections will then give more details of each individual component.

### 4. Model component

As mentioned above, the `Model` component stores and manage Agendum's task list data and user's preferences. It also exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' by other components e.g. the UI can be bound to this list and will automatically update when the data in the list change. It does not depend on other components such as `Logic` and `Storage`.  

The `Model` class is the interface of the `Model` component. It provides several APIs for the `Logic` and `UI` components to update and retrieve Agendumâ€™s task list data. The **API** of the model component can be found at [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/agendum/model/Model.java).  

The structure and relationship of the various classes in the `Model` component is described in the diagram below.    

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

`ModelManager` implements the `Model` Interface. It stores a `UserPref` Object which represents the userâ€™s preference. It stores multiple `ToDoList` objects, including the current and recent lists.  

Each `ToDoList` object has one `UniqueTaskList` object. A `UniqueTaskList` can contain multiple `Task` objects but does not allow duplicates.  

The `ReadOnlyToDoList` and `ReadOnlyTask` interfaces allow other classes and components, such as the `UI`, to access but not modify the list of tasks and their details.  

> * `ToDoList` can potentially be extended to have another `UniqueTagList` object to keep track of tags associated with each task and `ToDoList` will be responsible for syncing the tasks and tags.
> * `Name` is a class as it might be modified to have its own validation regex e.g. can only contain alphanumeric characters.

Using the same example, if the `Logic` component requests `Model` to _deleteTasks(task)_, the subsequent interactions between objects can be described by the following sequence diagram.  

<img src="images\SDforDeleteTaskModelComponent.png" width="800">

The identified task is removed from the `UniqueTaskList`. The `ModelManager` raises a `ToDoListChangedEvent` and back up the new to-do list to its history of saved lists.  

> `Model`â€™s _deleteTasks_ methods actually take in `ArrayList<ReadOnlyTask>` instead of a single task. We use _deleteTasks(task)_ for simplicity in the sequence diagram.

## Implementation

### 1. Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#2-configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

Currently, Agendum has 4 logging levels: `SEVERE`, `WARNING`, `INFO` and `FINE`. They record information pertaining to:

* `SEVERE` : A critical problem which may cause the termination of Agendum<br>
   e.g. fatal error during the initialization of Agendum's main window
* `WARNING` : A problem which requires attention and caution but allows Agendum to continue working<br>
   e.g. error reading from/saving to config file
* `INFO` : Noteworthy actions by Agendum<br>
  e.g. valid and invalid commands executed and their results
* `FINE` : Less significant details that may be useful in debugging<br>
  e.g. print the elements in actual list instead of just its size

### 2. Configuration

You can alter certain properties of our Agendum application (e.g. logging level) through the configuration file.
(default: `config.json`):

## Dev Ops

### 1. Build Automation

We use Gradle to run tests and manage library dependencies. The Gradle configuration for this project is defined in _build.gradle_.

### 2. Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our project. When code is pushed to this repository, Travis CI will run the project tests automatically to ensure that existing functionality will not be negatively affected by the changes.

### 3. Making a Release

To contribute a new release:

 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v1.1`
 2. [Create a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/)
    and upload the JAR file you created.

### 4. Managing Dependencies

Agendum depends on third-party libraries, such as the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these dependencies have been automated using Gradle. Gradle can download the dependencies automatically hence the libraries are not included in this repo and you do not need to download these libraries manually. To add a new dependency, update _build.gradle_.

## Appendix E : Product Survey

We conducted a product survey on other task managers. Here is a summary of the strengths and weaknesses of each application. The criteria used for evaluation are own preferences and Jim's requirements.

#### Wunderlist

*Strengths:*

* Clearly displays tasks that have not been completed
* Tasks can be categorized under different lists
* Tasks can have sub tasks
* Possible to highlight tasks by marking as important (starred) or pinning tasks
* Can set deadlines for tasks
* Can create recurring tasks
* Can associate files with tasks
* Can be used offline
* Keyboard friendly â€“ keyboard shortcuts to mark tasks as completed and important
* Search and sort functionality makes finding and organizing tasks easier
* Possible to synchronize across devices
* Give notifications and reminders for tasks near deadline or overdue

*Weaknesses:*

* Wunderlist has a complex interface and might require multiple clicks to get specific tasks done. For example, it has separate field to add tasks, search for tasks and a sort button. There are various lists & sub-lists. Each list has a completed/uncompleted  section and each task needs to be clicked to display the associated subtasks, notes, files and comment.
* New users might not know how to use the advanced features e.g. creating recurring tasks

#### Google calendar

*Strengths:*

* Have a weekly/monthly/daily calendar view which will make it easy for users to visualize their schedules
* Can create recurring events
* Integrated with Gmail. A user can add events from emails easily and this is desirable since Jim's to do items arrive by emails
* Can be used offline
* Possible to synchronize across devices
* Calendar can be exported to CSV/iCal for other users
* CLI to quick add an event to a calendar instead of clicking through the screen
* Comprehensive search by name/details/people involved/location/time


*Weaknesses:*

* Not possible to mark tasks as completed
* Not possible to add tasks without deadline or time
* CLI does not support updating of tasks/deleting etc. Still requires clicking.
* New users might not know of the keyboard shortcuts

#### Deleting a task : `delete`

You can delete tasks that you no longer want to keep track of.<br>
Format: `delete INDEX...`  

> * Deletes the task at the specified `INDEX`.
> * The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.
> * The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...

Examples:  

* `list` <br>
  `delete 2` <br>
  Deletes the 2nd task in the task list.

* `find movie` <br>
  `delete 1` <br>
  Deletes the 1st task in the results of the `find` command.

You can also delete multiple tasks in the task list with a single command.

Examples:

* `list` <br>
  `delete 2 3 4` <br>
  `delete 2,3,4` <br>
  `delete 2-4` <br>
  Each of the above command will delete the 2nd, 3rd and 4th task in the task list.  


#### Renaming a task : `rename`

If you find that the name of an existing task is not suitable, you can always rename it.<br>
Format: `rename INDEX NEW_TASK_NAME`  

> * Renames the task at the specified `INDEX`.
> * Index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.
> * The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...


> * Note that it is not possible to rename a task name to its original name and it might not be possible for the task to have the same name as another existing task

Examples:  

* `list` <br>
  `rename 2 Star Wars II` <br>
  Renames the 2nd task in the list to â€œStar Wars IIâ€?

* `find Star Trek`   <br>
  `rename 1 Star Wars II` <br>
  Renames the 1st task in the results of the `find` command to â€œStar Wars IIâ€?


#### Updating the date/time of a task : `schedule`

Have the deadline of your task been reduced or extended? Have an event been rescheduled? To change the date or time of a task, you can use this command.<br>
Format: `schedule INDEX [NEW_DATE_TIME_RESTRICTIONS]`

> * Schedule the task at the specified `INDEX`.
> * The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.
> * The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...
> * The time description must follow the format given in the add command examples

Examples:  

* `list` <br>
  `schedule 4` <br>
  Removes the deadline and start and end date/time for task 4 on the list.

* `list` <br>
  `schedule 2 by Fri`<br>
  Removes the deadline and start and end date/time for task 2 and resets the deadline to the coming Friday (If the current day is Friday, it would be the following Friday).

* `list`<br>
  `schedule 3 from 1 Oct 7pm to 1 Oct 9.30pm`<br>
  Sets the start time of task 3 to 1 Oct 7pm and the end time to 1 Oct 9.30pm respectively


#### Marking a task as completed : `mark`

If you have completed a task, you can mark it as completed by using the following command.<br>
Format: `mark INDEX...`

> * Mark the task at the specified `INDEX`.
> * The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.
> * The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...
> * The index can be in any order.

Examples:  

* `list`<br>
  `mark 5`<br>
  Marks the 5nd task in the list. Task 5 will then be moved to the **"Done"** panel as described below<br>
  <img src="images/UiMarkTask.png" width="800"><br>


* `find Homework`<br>
  `mark 1`<br>
  Marks the 1st task in the list of results of the `find` command.

If you had a productive day, Agendum can save you the hassle of marking multiple tasks one by one. You can also mark multiple tasks as completed with a single command.

Examples:

* `list`<br>
  `mark 2 3 4`<br>
  `mark 2,3,4` <br>
  `mark 2-4` <br>
  Each of the above command will mark the 2nd, 3rd and 4th task as completed.  


#### Unmarking a task as completed : `unmark`

You might change your mind and want to continue working on a recently completed task. To reflect these changes in Agendum, follow this command: <br>
Format: `unmark INDEX...`
This works in the same way as the `mark` command. The tasks will then be moved to the **"Do It Soon"** or **"Do It Anytime"** panel accordingly. <br>


#### Undo the last command : `undo`  

If you have accidentally made a mistake in the previous commands, you can use the 'undo' command to remedy it.<br>
Multiple undo actions are also supported.<br>
Format: `undo`

Examples:

* `add homework`<br>
  `undo`<br>
  The task "homework" which has been added previously, will be removed.

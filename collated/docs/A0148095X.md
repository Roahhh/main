### 5. Storage component

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/agendum/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component has the following functions:

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Agendum data in xml format and read it back.

The Object Diagram below shows what it looks like during runtime.

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the storage class will interact with model when `Load` command is executed.

### 6. Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.agendum.commons` package.

They are further separated into sub-packages - namely `core`, `events`, `exceptions` and `util`.

* Core - This package consists of the essential classes that are required by multiple components.
* Events -This package consists of the different type of events that can occur; these are used mainly by EventManager and EventBus.
* Exceptions - This package consists of exceptions that may occur with the use of Agendum.
* Util - This package consists of additional utilities for the different components.

## Testing

You can find all the test files in the `./src/test/java` folder.

### Types of Tests

#### 1. GUI Tests

These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI.
They are in the `guitests` package.

#### 2. Non-GUI Tests

These are tests that do not involve the GUI. They include,
   * _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `seedu.agendum.commons.StringUtilTest` tests the correctness of StringUtil methods e.g. if a source string contains a query string, ignoring letter cases.
   * _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units
     (individual code units are assumed to be working).<br>
      e.g. `seedu.agendum.storage.StorageManagerTest` tests if StorageManager is correctly connected to other storage components such as JsonUserPrefsStorage.
   * Hybrids of _unit and integration tests_. These tests are checking multiple code units as well as
      how the are connected together.<br>
      e.g. `seedu.agendum.logic.LogicManagerTest` will check various code units from the `Model` and `Logic` components.

#### 3. Headless Mode GUI Tests

Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use,
our GUI tests can be run in [headless mode](#headless-mode). <br>
See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests)  for instructions on how to run tests in headless mode.

### How to Test

#### 1. Using Eclipse

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run as` > `JUnit Test`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose to run as a JUnit test.

#### 2. Using Gradle

* Launch a terminal on Mac or command window in Windows. Navigate to Agendumâ€™s project directory. We recommend cleaning the project before running all tests in headless mode with the following command `./gradlew clean headless allTests` on Mac and `gradlew clean headless allTests` on Windows.
* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for more details on how to run tests using Gradle.

>#### Troubleshooting tests
>**Problem: Tests fail because NullPointException when AssertionError is expected**

>* Reason: Assertions are not enabled for JUnit tests.
   This can happen if you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later)
>* Solution: Enable assertions in JUnit tests as described
   [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option). <br>
   Delete run configurations created when you ran tests earlier.

#### Creating an alias for a command : `alias`

If you are looking for alternatives or want to type a command faster, you can use the `alias` comand.<br>
You can use both new and old command aliases to carry out the same action.<br>
Format: `alias ORIGINAL_COMMAND_NAME NEW_COMMAND_NAME`  

> * NEW_COMMAND_NAME must be a single word.
> * ORIGINAL_COMMAND_NAME must be a command word that is specified in the Command Summary section
> * When creating an alias for a command with a pre-existing alias, the pre-existing alias will be overriden.

Examples:

* `alias mark m` <br>
  you can now use`m` or `mark` to mark a task as completed.<br>
  `alias mark mk`<br>
  Now you can only use `mk` or `mark` to mark a task; `m` has been overriden.


#### Removing an alias command : `unalias`

If you no longer want to use the alternative alias command, you can remove it.
Format: `unalias NEW_COMMAND_NAME` or `unalias ORIGINAL_COMMAND_NAME`

> * NEW_COMMAND_NAME must be a user-defined command word.
> * ORIGINAL_COMMAND_NAME must be a command word that is specified in the Command Summary section

Examples:

* `unalias m`<br>
  `m` can no longer be used to mark tasks.<br>
  `unalias mark`<br>
  The assigned alias for `mark` will be removed; Now you can only use the original command `mark` to mark a task as completed.


#### Specifying the data storage location : `store`

If you want to store the task list data in a different location, you can specifiy it using this command.
The task list data will be moved to the specific directory, and future data will be saved in that location.<br>
Format: `store PATH_TO_FILE`

> * PATH_TO_FILE must be a valid path to a file on the local computer.
> * If a file at PATH_TO_FILE exists, it will be overriden.
> * The previous data storage file will not be deleted.

Examples:
* `store C:/Dropbox/ToDo/mytasklist.xml`


#### Loading from another data storage location : `load`

If you have another data file with existing task data, you can load it into Agendum. <br><br>
Format: `load PATH_TO_FILE`

> * PATH_TO_FILE must be a valid path to a file on the local computer.
> * Existing data will be saved and stored in the existing data storage location.
> * The task list in Agendum will be replaced by the loaded task list.
> * Future data will be stored in PATH_TO_FILE.

Examples:
* `load data/mytasklist.xml`

#### Exiting the program : `exit`

If you have finished using the application, you can use this command to exit the program.<br>
Format: `exit`  


#### Keyboard Shortcuts

1. Use the <kbd>UP ARROW</kbd> and <kbd>DOWN ARROW</kbd> to scroll through earlier commands.
2. If you are entering a new command, use the <kbd>DOWN ARROW</kbd> to instantly clear the command line.


#### Saving the data

Agendum saves its data into the specified data storage location, or by default it saves into `todolist.xml`. This saving automatically happens whenever the task list is changed; There is no need to save manually.


&nbsp;


## FAQ

<html>
<dl>
   <dt> Q: How do I transfer my data to another computer? </dt>
   <dd> Firstly, take note of the data storage location that your current todo list is saved at. You can check this by looking at the            bottom-right of Agendum. Navigate to this location and copy the data file to a portable USB device or hard disk. Then, ensure            that you have installed Agendum in the other computer. Copy the data file from your device onto the other computer, preferrably          in the same folder as Agendum. Use the <code>load</code> command to load it into Agendum. </dd>

   <dt> Q: Why did Agendum complain about an invalid file directory? </dt>
   <dd> Check if the directory you wish to relocate to exists, or if you have enough administrator privileges. </dd>

   <dt> Q: Can Agendum remind me when my task is due soon? </dt>
   <dd> Agendum will always show the tasks that are due soon at the top of list. However, Agendum will not show you a reminder. </dd>

## Introduction

Agendum is a task manager for busy users to manage their schedules and tasks via keyboard commands. It is a Java desktop application that has a **GUI** implemented with JavaFX.

This guide describes the design and implementation of Agendum. It will help developers (like you) understand how Agendum works and how to further contribute to its development. We have organized this guide in a top-down manner so that you can understand the big picture before moving on to the more detailed sections. Each sub-section is mostly self-contained to provide ease of reference.


## Setting up

### Prerequisites

* **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or above<br>

    > This application will not work with any earlier versions of Java 8.

* **Eclipse** IDE

* **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in
   [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious))

* **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the
   [Eclipse Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/buildship-gradle-integration)


### Importing the project into Eclipse

1. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer

2. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given in the prerequisites above)

3. Click `File` > `Import`

4. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`

5. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory

6. Click `Finish`

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish
      (Gradle needs time to download library files from servers during the project set up process)
  > * If Eclipse automatically changed any settings during the import process, you can discard those changes.

    > After you are done importing Agendum, it will be a good practice to enable assertions before developing. This will enable Agendum app to verify assumptions along the way. To enable assertions, follow the instructions [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5509082/eclipse-enable-assertions)

### Troubleshooting project setup

* **Problem: Eclipse reports compile errors after new commits are pulled from Git**
	* Reason: Eclipse fails to recognize new files that appeared due to the Git pull.
	* Solution: Refresh the project in Eclipse:<br>

* **Problem: Eclipse reports some required libraries missing**
	* Reason: Required libraries may not have been downloaded during the project import.
	* Solution: [Run tests using Gardle](UsingGradle.md) once (to refresh the libraries).

### 2. UI component

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/agendum/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit the abstract `UiPart` class. They can be loaded using `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/agendum/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component has the following functions:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

## Appendix B : Use Cases

>For all use cases below, the **System** is `Agendum` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified otherwise

1. Actor requests to list tasks
2. System shows a list of tasks
3. Actor requests to delete a specific task in the list by its index
4. System deletes the task.

6. Use case ends.

**Extensions**

2a. The list is empty

> Use case ends

3a. The given index is invalid

> 3a1. System shows an error message (â€œPlease select a task on the list with a valid indexâ€?) <br>
> Use case resumes at step 2

### Use case 03 - Rename a task

**MSS**

1. Actor requests to list tasks
2. System shows a list of tasks
3. Actor requests to rename a specific task in the list by its index and also input the new task name
4. System updates the task
5. System shows a feedback message (â€œTask `index` updatedâ€?) and displays the updated list
6. Use case ends.

#### Retrieving task list : `list`

You might want to view the lists to all overdue, upcoming and completed tasks again.<br>
Format: `list`

#### Finding tasks containing keywords: `find`

If you have a long list of tasks and need to find only specific ones, you can use this command to search for tasks which contain any of the given keywords.<br>
Format: `find KEYWORD``...`  

  > * The search is not case sensitive. e.g `assignment` will match `Assignment`
  > * The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `2 essay` will match `essay 2`
  > * Only the name is searched
  > * Only full words will be matched e.g. `work` will not match `homework`
  > * Tasks matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `2103` will match `2101 and 2103 assignment`

Examples:  

* `find Dory` <br>
  Returns `Shark & Dory` and `dory`  

* `find Nemo Dory` <br>
  Returns all tasks that contain `Dory` or `Nemo`  

```
